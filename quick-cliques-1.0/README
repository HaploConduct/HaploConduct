Quick Cliques: A package to efficiently compute all maximal cliques in sparse graphs

The intent of this software package is to give you the ability to reproduce the 
experimental results from the conference paper:

Listing All Maximal Cliques in Large Sparse Real-World Graphs
D. Eppstein and D. Strash
Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Experimental Algorithms (SEA 2011), 
LNCS vol. 6630, pp. 403-414.
doi:10.1007/978-3-642-20662-7_31
arXiv:1103.0318

and the journal version of that paper:

Listing All Maximal Cliques in Large Sparse Real-World Graphs in Near-Optimal Time
D. Eppstein, M. LÃ¶ffler, and D. Strash
Journal of Experimental Algorithmics 18 (3): 3.1, 2013
doi:10.1145/2543629

This package includes:
    o The complete C code for the four implementations compared in the paper. (see ./src)
    o The complete doxygen-generated documentation of the code (see ./doc)
    o The test script used to build and run the experiments exactly as in the paper. (./test.sh)
    o A small subset of the data used in experiments (see ./data)
      [ The full data was too large for GitHub, you can download it from here:
        http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dstrash/data.tar.gz ]

For instructions on how to use this program see doc/index.html

Or, just type `make' in the terminal, and then execute test.sh.
