REQUIREMENTS:
************

The SAVAGE program is a combination of C++ code (which has to be compiled) 
and Python scripts (version 2.6 or later, but not Python 3.x). The C++ part
requires several boost libraries (boost::timer, boost::system, and 
boost::program_options) and it needs OpenMP.

SAVAGE uses the quick-cliques package 
(https://github.com/darrenstrash/quick-cliques) for maximal clique 
enumeration. It needs the cliques to be output one-by-one, as is the case in 
the included quick-cliques release.

Finally, SAVAGE requires 'makeblastdb' and 'blastn' from the ncbi toolkit.
