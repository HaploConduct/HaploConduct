# POLYTE: POLYploid genome fitTEr

## Synopsis

POLYTE is a method for reconstructing haplotigs for diploid and polyploid
genomes. The principles of SAVAGE have been adjusted to a low-coverage setting,
where the ploidy of the organism is known. POLYTE follows an iterative scheme
where in each iteration reads or contigs are joined, based on their interplay in
terms of an underlying haplotype-aware overlap graph. Along the iterations,
contigs grow while preserving their haplotype identity. POLYTE has been shown
to produce very accurate and complete assemblies, reaching high target genome
reconstruction values at extremely low error rates.
