SAVAGE is a computational tool for reconstructing individual 
haplotypes of intra-host virus strains (a viral quasispecies) without 
the need for a high quality reference genome. SAVAGE makes use of 
either FM-index based data structures or ad-hoc consensus reference 
sequence for constructing overlap graphs from patient sample data. 
In this overlap graph, nodes represent reads and/or contigs, while 
edges reflect that two reads/contigs, based on sound statistical 
considerations, represent identical haplotypic sequence.  
Following an iterative scheme, a new overlap assembly algorithm that 
is based on the enumeration of statistically well-calibrated groups 
of reads/contigs then efficiently reconstructs the individual 
haplotypes from this overlap graph.
  
*****************************
REQUIREMENTS and INSTALLATION:
*****************************

The SAVAGE program is a combination of C++ code (which has to be compiled) 
and Python scripts (version 2.6 or later, but not Python 3.x). The C++ part
requires several boost libraries (boost::timer, boost::system, and 
boost::program_options) and it needs OpenMP.

For maximal clique enumeration, SAVAGE depends on the quick-cliques package 
(https://github.com/darrenstrash/quick-cliques) which is included. 

Stages b and c of the algorithm also require BLAST from the ncbi C++ 
Toolkit.

Complete installation instructions can be found in the INSTALL file.

General remarks:
***************

SAVAGE expects as input single- and/or paired-end reads. For the paired-end 
reads, it assumes they are stored both on the same strand (hence resulting 
in F-F alignments) as output by PEAR (Paired-End reAd mergeR; 
http://sco.h-its.org/exelixis/web/software/pear/).
